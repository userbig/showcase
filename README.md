# Hi

This is a tiny showcase with some code examples for Vue and php code


## DnD Menu
This part designed to make a different menu using drag and drop functionality. It is highly dependent on the VueJS 
part of building the menu structure. PHP is used for rendering and updating structure in a database.


## EditorJS-renderer
This one is a renderer for a block-style text [editor](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) (really cool one).
